## _"When cryptography is outlawed, bayl bhgynjf jvyy unir cevinpl."_


**Hallo, Wie geht’s?** This is my hugo personal blog. The main motivation for writing this was to provide some details, dataset and useful public infomration about projects that I'm interested.

```bash
root@voidlinux:/home/anon# cat whoami.rs | less
```

```rust
pub struct me {
    nickname: &'static str = "oliveira-sh";
    languages: Vec<&'static str> = vec!["🇧🇷", "🇬🇧", "🇩🇪"];
    interests: Vec<&'static str> = vec![
        "🐶 Dogs",
        "🎮 Gaming",
        "📚 Reading",
        "₿ Cryptocurrency's",
    ];
}
```

Although the blog theme seems simple, it is actually fully functional. _"Keep it simple, but not simpler"_.

All pages not under the root directory of the website are listed below. You can also visit the list page of a single section, e.g., [posts](/post/), or [notes](/note/).
